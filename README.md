## 📌 Project Objective

To build a machine learning model that predicts whether a patient is at **High Risk** or **Low Risk** of heart disease based on clinical features such as:

- Age
- Blood Pressure
- Cholesterol
- Heart Rate
- ECG Results
- Exercise Induced Angina
- ST Depression
- Number of Major Vessels

The system supports early diagnosis and preventive healthcare analytics.

## 🧠 Business Problem

Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death globally. Early detection can significantly reduce mortality rates.

Hospitals generate vast clinical data, but manual risk assessment is time-consuming and error-prone.

This project provides:

- Automated disease prediction
- Real-time patient risk scoring
- Clinical decision support
- Preventive healthcare insights
